            I am just this 12 year old kid with big aspirations (Youtuber,Software Developer and Techie),<br> 
            But I cant pursue any of that before getting to collage and living by myself without my parents to pressurize me for studying 24/7 (parents do that especially in collage) <br>
            Thats It.

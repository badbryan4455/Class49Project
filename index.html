    <p align = left> Hello and Welcome, so today We are going over Origami.  <br> <br> <b>Origami is basically 
        just folding paper into shapes. </b>
        Thats all you need to know. <br>
        <font face = "Segoe Print" size = 6>
        <p align =center> Did You Know? </p> </font>
        1. Origami is derived from two Japanese words: Ori (folded) and Kami (paper) <br> <br>
        2. Akira Yoshizawa is considered the Grand Master of modern Origami. He created over 50,000 
        origami models, invented wet-folding, and developed <br> 
        method of diagramming origami instructions. <br> <br>
        3. The fastest time to make 100 origami cranes is 40 minutes 35 seconds, achieved by Yoneyama 
        Yuichi (Japan) in Nagoya, Japan, on 30 November 2010. <br> <br>
        4. Initially, the art of paper folding was restricted only to ceremonial occasions because 
        paper was scarce and expensive.

        Now this is what I was talking about. Things made by folding paper. 
        Here is an example with a panda. <br>
